Rofi-hkey
=========

This program is an integration of the "hkey" concept with the convenience of rofi menus.
It functions as a highly customizable and very precise launcher, allowing the user to associate specific entries or hotkeys with specific shell commands. Additionally, it can run commands with arguments, such as `g <search entry>`.
It has the ability to show and select entries, and also to add, edit and remove them.
This project is particularly useful and has become my favorite. It was written in Go to learn more about the language. In the future, I may consider rewriting it in Python and expanding its functionality.
