Cleaner
=======

This script is a basic system cleaner for Linux.
It manages cache, history, and logs by creating an archive of them and then deletes them, except for logs which are truncated.
Also, it deletes broken symbolic links, unnecessary files/folders, and orphaned packages.
The goal is to keep the system clean and optimized by eliminating unnecessary data and files.
