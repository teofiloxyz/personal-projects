Notifications
=============

This script is menu tool for managing notifications.
It allows users to schedule notifications, view all scheduled notifications, remove or edit them, and even schedule notifications immediately by providing arguments (without opening the menu).
The script also has the ability to save all notifications to history and to keep track of unseen notifications, providing a more robust notification management experience.
To accomplish that, it includes a daemon component that saves all notifications to history.
The script also has the functionality to send scheduled notifications that are due.
Finally, it has the ability to read calendar .ics files with alarms to schedule notifications.

I find this project particularly useful, specially when using a tiling window manager that does not provide extended notification support, such as memorizing history, showing unseen notifications and manually schedule notifications (and even auto-schedule by reading calendar files with alarms).
