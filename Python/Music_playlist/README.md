Music Playlist
==============

This script is a simple menu-based tool for managing music playlists.
It allows the user to view all songs, play music by searching by title, ID, or genre, creating a subplaylist based on that search, add, remove, or edit music titles and genres.
When removing from the "active" playlist, it adds the song to an "archive" playlist, from which it can be recovered later.
It also has the functionality to export playlist to a CSV file, and it can take a TXT file with titles or youtube links, and downloads all the entries provided,
Also, the script can be run with arguments, to add or play immediately, making it a versatile and efficient simple tool.
