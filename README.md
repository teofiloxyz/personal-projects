# Personal Projects

This repo has some of my personal projects that I use on a daily basis.
These projects are just for showcase. Don't expect them to work on your machine.
It's mostly Python scripts.
There's just a few (Bash) shell scripts here, which are a bit old.
I also have been programing in Go (Golang).
