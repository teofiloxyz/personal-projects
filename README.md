Personal Projects
=================

This repo contains some of my personal projects that I use on a regular basis.
These projects are merely for display, so don't expect them to work on your machine.
All the code was completely written by me.

It's mostly Python scripts.
There's just a few (Bash) shell scripts here, which are a bit old.
I've also been programing in Go (Golang).
